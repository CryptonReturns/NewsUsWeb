        'BENGALURU: Just when it looked like sport in the country was picking up the pieces after the lockdown, badminton has been hit by a severe shortage of shuttles.\nYonex shuttles, which are used by a big majority of players in the country, including the national campers, are in short supply, with many dealers admitting that they are down to the last few tubes.\nSources attributed the shortage to a ban imposed by the central government on shuttle imports from China.\nImport of shuttles is not possible now as the government has banned all feathered products from China," the sources said.\n"We have not received shuttles for the Thomas & Uber Cup camp and are using from our existing stocks.\nIf we do not receive shuttles soon, it will impact the training in sometime," Gopichand said.\nAcademies and training centres have been judiciously using the old stock or getting shuttles in small quantities from friends overseas.\nA solution needs to be found soon." With the shelf life of shuttles being very limited, some percentage of the old stock may be past its use-by date, sources pointed out.\n"There is no point in training with brittle shuttles.\nAlso, with Covid-19 protocols curbing reuse of shuttles, we need a steady supply and for that imports will have to be allowed," the sources said.',

        "But there have been a few superhuman efforts from the batsmen in the tournament, where they have not only scored centuries, but also done it in double quick time, in turn benefiting their team in a big way.\nTimesofIndia.com here takes a look at the fastest centuries scored in the IPL over the past 12 editions: Chris Gayle (2013) - 30 ballsOn April 23, 2013 the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, along with the rest of the world witnessed a carnage by Chris Gayle, as the Jamaican scored the fastest century ever in the IPL against Pune Warriors off just 30 balls.\nPlaying for Royal Challengers Bangalore, the Gayle storm hit the stadium as the fans witnessed a power hitting masterclass from the left-hander.\nWithout breaking a sweat, Gayle, in that match, mercilessly smacked the Pune bowlers all over the park, eventually finishing with a mind boggling 66-ball 175* -- the highest score by a batsman in the IPL and in T20 cricket.\nRiding on that effort by Gayle, RCB scored 263/5 -- the highest ever team total in IPL.\nStunned by the effort from Gayle, Pune Warriors just didn't know how to react in the mammoth run-chase and were eventually restricted to 133/9, handing RCB a 130-run win in that unforgettable match.\nIn one such instance on March 13, 2010, a gutted Yusuf Pathan was left feeling all the weight of disappointments after his team, Rajasthan Royals lost the match by just four runs while in pursuit of the target of 213 set by Mumbai Indians.\nEven after scoring a breathtaking ton that came off just 37 balls, an unfortunate run out at the wrong juncture of the chase meant that despite the fantastic effort his team lost the nail-biter.\nFor three years, Yusuf held the record of the fastest IPL ton, before RCB's Chris Galye broke it in 2013.\nWith 8 fours and 9 sixes, Yusuf in that match, struck the ball at a deadly strike rate of over 270, making the MI bowlers just fell helpless.\nDavid Miller (2013) - 38 ballsArguably one of the most entertaining editions of the IPL was 2013, where the cricketing world witnessed a slew of records being broken and new ones made.\nAfter a record-shattering 'Gayle storm' earlier in the season, the fans, a few days later, witnessed one of the most delightful T20 knocks ever played in a run-chase.\nAnd it was the dynamic South African batsman David Miller, who produced the sensational knock for Kings XI Punjab against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.\n5 and produced the T20 knock of his life, hitting a 38-ball ton and winning the game for his team.\nWith a colossal strike rate of over 265, Miller left RCB shell-shocked, taking his team to a 6-wicket win with 12 balls to spare.\nWith Miller on 95 and just 3 runs to win, the six from the left-hander to take his team across the finish-line and also reach a personal three-figure mark made the ton even more special.\nAnd Gilchrist didn't miss a chance to entertain the fans, as he played some of the most devastating knocks in the tournament.\nChasing a tricky total of 155, Gilchrist produced a masterclass, leading his team to a phenomenal 10-wicket win.\nWith a total of 9 fours and 10 sixes, Gilchrist eventually went on to score an unbeaten 109 off 47 balls that came at a strike rate of over 231.\nEven after 12 editions of the tournament, Gilchrist's knock still stands fourth on the list of fastest centuries scored in the IPL.\nBut the most cherished knocks from De Villiers and Warner perhaps were scored in 2016 and 2017 respectively, when they scored a 43-ball century each for their teams.\nDuring his unbeaten 52-ball 129, de Villiers hit 10 fours and 12 sixes at a strike rate of over 248 to set up an RCB win.",

The IPL begins in Abu Dhabi on September 19.Chappell feels the high-profile T20 event might just be a blessing in disguise for the Indians and the Australians, with just a few series possible since mid-March because of the pandemic.\u201cOne thing is certain: where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way, and the better players are dedicated to finding a solution,\u201d Chappell wrote in a column for ESPNcricinfo.com..\u201cIn case of Indian players, and some of the Australians, they will at least have some challenging IPL cricket in the lead-up to the December series.\u201dChappell admitted the IPL \u201cmay not seem like ideal preparation for a tough Test series in Australia\u201d but he recalled the thoughts of former England batsman Ravi Bopara in 2009.\u201cAfter a stint in the IPL, Bopara was asked on return to England if this was appropriate preparation for a Test match.\nHe proved his point emphatically by scoring back-to-back centuries against West Indies.\u201dThe 76-year-old legend said with a host of health and safety protocols in place, it is difficult for visiting teams to prevail over home sides in the COVID-19 era.\u201cWith venue bubbles, isolation rules, social distancing, and a number of changes to playing conditions, adapting to international competition has been testing for players.\nIt\u2019s made life difficult and different even in a team environment but imagine the individual\u2019s dilemma in enforced isolation with a tour looming,\u201d he said.\u201cThe physical preparation is not so difficult, especially for self-starters, but how do you stay in cricket shape?\u201dBut the former captain said the Indians very well understand the stakes associated with the tour of Australia and will leave no stone unturned in their preparations for the series.\u201cThe Indian players could well adopt this attitude for a series in Australia that will impact the Border-Gavaskar trophy, the World Test Championship, and their personal pride.\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely India will have the luxury of lead-up matches against tough opposition.",

        "Long viewed as a pure clay-courter, Dominic Thiem has evolved into a strong competitor on hard courts, improving his winning percentage on the surface from 53 in 2017 to 76 this year.\nThe Austrian pushed Rafael Nadal to five sets in the 2018 US Open classic, won his first Masters title last year against Roger Federer at Indian Wells and finished the season with wins over both the Swiss and Novak Djokovic at the ATP Finals.\nNow, the 27-year-old is in his second-straight hard court Grand Slam final, and we take a look at what\u2019s working for him.Like most clay specialists, Thiem used to play from well behind the baseline on hard courts.\nIn the five-set quarterfinal loss to Nadal in New York two years ago, Thiem came in 31 times, winning 21 points; a success rate of 68 per cent.\nIn January, he defeated Nadal in the Australian Open quarterfinal in four sets, where he won 26 of 33 net points (79%).\nThiem traded Tour Finals group wins with Federer in 2018 and 2019, losing the former with a net point success rate of 41% (7 of 17) and winning the latter with 78% (14 of 18).\nImproved positioning has resulted in better volleys and fewer unforced errors.Speaking about his Australian Open final run this year, Thiem admitted: \u201cI told myself, \u2018If I can be in the finals in London, the ATP Finals, why not as well in a hard-court Slam?\u2019 Since then I know that I\u2019m also playing very well on the faster surfaces.\u201dThiem carried his form onto the GreenSet Plexicushion courts at the Australian Open and has got only better on US Open\u2019s faster Laykold surface.\nThiem fought hard in Melbourne \u2014 Aussie world No. 151 Alex Bolt stretched him to five sets in the second round.\nAt the US Open, Thiem took advantage of a more favourable draw and has only dropped one set en route to the final.Early last year, Thiem split with childhood coach Gunter Bresnik and abandoned the idea of replicating his clay-court game on hard courts.\n\u201cI come to the net more often, I improved my volleys, my serves, my returns.",

        "After one errant forehand in the first set of the U.S. Open final, Naomi Osaka looked at her coach in the mostly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium stands with palms up, as if to say, \u201cWhat the heck is happening?\u201dIn response to another wayward forehand against Victoria Azarenka seconds later, Osaka chucked her racket.\nBy the end, Osaka pulled away to a 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 comeback victory for her second U.S. Open championship and third Grand Slam title overall.A quarter-century had passed since the last time the woman who lost the first set of a U.S. Open final wound up winning: In 1994, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario did it against Steffi Graf.This one was a back-and-forth affair.\nShe held four break points in the next game \u2014 convert any of those, and she would have served for the win at 5-1 \u2014 but Azarenka didn\u2019t flinch.Azarenka held there, somehow, and broke to get to 4-3, then stood and stretched during the ensuing changeover.But Osaka regained control, breaking to start a match-ending run of three games, covering her face when the final was over.Osaka, a 22-year-old born in Japan and now based in the United States, added to her trophies from the 2018 U.S. Open \u2014 earned with a brilliant performance in a memorably chaotic final against Serena Williams \u2014 and 2019 Australian Open.The 23,000-plus seats in the main arena at Flushing Meadows were not entirely unclaimed, just mostly so \u2014 while fans were not allowed to attend because of the coronavirus pandemic, dozens of people who worked at the tournament attended \u2014 and the cavernous place was not entirely silent, just mostly so.Certainly no thunderous applause or cacophony of yells that normally would reverberate over and over and over again through the course of a Grand Slam final, accompanying the players\u2019 introductions or preceding the first point or after the greatest of shots.Instead, a polite smattering of claps from several hands marked such moments.Osaka stepped onto the court wearing a black mask with the name of Tamir Rice, a Black 12-year-old boy killed by police in Ohio in 2014.\nShe joined athletes in various sports by refusing to compete last month after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin \u2014 she said she wouldn\u2019t participate in her semifinal at the Western & Southern Open, then decided to play after the tournament took a full day off in solidarity.Osaka and her coach have said they think the off-court activism has helped her energy and mindset in matches.",

        "Naomi Osaka has been the dominant storyline of the 2020 U.S. Open, both for on-court performances that mean she will be playing in Saturday\u2019s final and for her vocal support of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.Before each match, Osaka has worn a mask bearing the name of a different Black American in a powerful symbol of her support for the fight against racial injustice in the United States.Osaka, who has a Japanese mother and Haitian father, may represent Japan but she lives in Los Angeles and has joined several BLM protests across the country this year.Although her focus has been on racial injustice over the last few months, the 23-year-old has long been a symbol for change in Japan.Osaka is one of the country\u2019s most recognised personalities and has become the face of a changing Japan coming to terms with challenges to its self-image as a racially homogenous society.Baye McNeil, a prominent Japan-based African-American author and activist, sees Osaka as the next in a line of great Black athlete activists such as boxer Muhammad Ali and sprinter Jesse Owens.\u201cMuhammad Ali\u2026 put his career on the line in order to protest things that he thought were unjust or just wrong.\nNot necessarily for her impact on America but on Japan.\u201cI kind of think of her as a Jesse Owens of Japan.\u201dMcNeil, who moved to Japan 16 years ago, believes Osaka and other biracial athletes like basketball player Rui Hachimura and Chicago Cubs pitcher Yu Darvish can be catalysts for change just by competing.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even require them to say anything, you just look at them and say \u2018Oh my God, this is a Black woman representing Japan,\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cThis is something Japan has never faced before and I am not sure how exactly they are going to resolve this, or how they are going to modify the narrative, but some modification is required.\u201dJaime Smith, who helped organise June\u2019s BLM protest in Tokyo, thinks many Japanese people do not see Osaka\u2019s activism as relating to their own country.\u201cThey see it from the viewpoint that she is a Black American woman, even though she\u2019s half Japanese, and she is speaking out about an American problem, so I still think there\u2019s some wilful ignorance there,\u201d Smith told Reuters.\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of mindset we are trying to change.\u201dSmith, who moved from the U.S. to Japan three years ago, sees Osaka as the perfect person to push through this change.\u201cShe is at a point where she is huge worldwide and people can\u2019t help but listen to her,\u201d she said.\u201cI think this is the perfect time to do what she is doing.\u201dFollowing her 2018 U.S. Open triumph, Osaka attracted a large number of sponsors, many of them big Japanese brands, and became the world\u2019s highest paid female athlete, according to Forbes.These sponsors have not always been supportive of Osaka\u2019s campaigning against racial injustice, however.A report in Japanese newspaper Mainichi on Friday cited unnamed sources at one of her sponsors as criticising her BLM stance, saying they would prefer her to concentrate on tennis.If some in Japan are struggling to come to terms with Osaka\u2019s activism, this was not apparent at Tokyo\u2019s Godai tennis club on Saturday morning.\u201cWith the face masks, I perceive a kind of determination that she is facing her matches with these thoughts,\u201d said Chika Hyodo.\u201cI think she is trying to fulfil the role she was given as an athlete and I feel awesome about it.",

        "As Britney (Francesca Scorsese), a teen living on base, explains it to new kid Fraser (Jack Dylan Grazer), all the military stores like it are precisely alike, down to the same items in the same places in the same aisles.\nThat process is the subject of \u201cWe Are Who We Are,\u201d the languid, lusty, sun-baked teen drama from Luca Guadagnino (\u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d) that begins Monday on HBO.We meet Fraser, in fact, staring at a \u201cLost and Found\u201d sign at an Italian airport, where he has arrived with his mother Sarah (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), the new commander of the base, and his other mother, Maggie (Alice Braga).\nSulky and withdrawn under a protective helmet of bleached hair \u2014 he would rather have stayed home in New York \u2014 he sets off to explore the base and Chioggia, running into a group of Army kids off for an afternoon at the beach.Introverted and flinchy, Fraser is an unsettling character to enter the story through, with an awkward, defensive personality and hints of a troubled past.\n(Sevigny, who made her debut in Larry Clark\u2019s 1995 teen-panic flick, \u201cKids,\u201d is nuanced and convincing as the commanding officer uncertain on the home front.) But he is a lot of work, maybe more work than you\u2019ll want to invest as a viewer.But \u201cWe Are\u201d opens outward with the second episode, which shows us the same day through the eyes of Fraser\u2019s neighbor Caitlin (Jordan Kristine Seam\u00f3n, an astonishing newcomer).\nShe\u2019s more settled than Fraser \u2014 popular and close to her conservative father (Scott Mescudi, better known as the rapper Kid Cudi) \u2014 but is also searching for her place, experimenting with her gender expression and testing her friendships.As the two meet and form a close, platonic alliance, the focus broadens to Caitlin\u2019s circle of friends \u2014 white and Black, Christian and Muslim, American and European, military and civilian, all thrown together in a limbo that\u2019s both America and Italy and yet not wholly either, living a curious existence that\u2019s both tightly regimented and exhilaratingly free.I\u2019m not sure if this is a realistic portrait either of overseas base life or of military family dynamics, but the uncanniness of the setting feels key to the story.\nThe physical location is simply an otherworldly backdrop for its flirtations and fights to play out against, like an enchanted wood in a Shakespeare comedy.It\u2019s funny that it took an Italian director to see the potential in the stories of American military kids.\nBut then again, an American might have been more burdened by the urge to comment topically.There\u2019s little military politics in the first four episodes (of eight), other than a slowly percolating subplot about deploying soldiers to Afghanistan.\nAnd American politics creep in only at the edges, with ads and TV footage from the Trump and Clinton campaigns (the series is set in 2016) and the MAGA hats that Caitlin\u2019s father orders for the two of them, though campaign gear is forbidden on base.All these touches, so far, feel more like quirkily deployed set dressing than statements.\nThe camera revels in the Labrador-like energy with which these kids \u2014 except Fraser \u2014 leap into any available body of water.There\u2019s a lot of leaping in \u201cWe Are Who We Are,\u201d figurative and literal.\nThe young characters make impulsive life decisions with the same energy they use for dangerous, illicit rides on the Army-base zip line.\nIt\u2019s a finely detailed, living fresco of libido and intoxication, all these teenagers inhabiting their bodies as if they were just-unwrapped birthday presents.Last year, HBO\u2019s teen drama \u201cEuphoria\u201d tried to capture this same sense of chaos but with a glum, dire, shock-the-parents sensibility, treating adolescence like a minefield.",

Theo Kojak, on \u201cKojak,\u201d the wildly popular crime drama about Manhattan detectives.Four years after that show\u2019s run came to an end in 1978, Mr. Dobson found success again when he was cast as Detective Mack MacKenzie for the fourth season of \u201cKnots Landing,\u201d a CBS soap opera revolving around married couples in suburban Los Angeles.\nHe reprised the role in a 1997 mini-series, \u201cKnots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac,\u201d and joined fellow cast members to look back in a 2005 special, \u201cKnots Landing Reunion: Together Again.\u201dIn recent years he returned to his daytime TV roots with recurring roles on \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful\u201d and \u201cDays of Our Lives.\u201dMr. Dobson was less active on the big screen than the small one, but he did appear in some notable films, including \u201cMidway\u201d (1976), as part of an all-star cast that also included Henry Fonda and Charlton Heston, and the 1981 romantic comedy \u201cAll Night Long,\u201d in which his character was married to Barbra Streisand\u2019s.In 1981 he played Mike Hammer, the hard-boiled detective created by Mickey Spillane, in the CBS television movie \u201cMargin for Murder.\u201d \u201cMr. Dobson is given a valuable opportunity to step outside of his usual \u2018nice guy\u2019 image,\u201d John J.\nHe then served for two years in the Army as a military policeman in Maryland and, after returning to New York, worked as conductor on the Long Island Rail Road and studied with the noted acting teacher Sanford Meisner.Mr. Dobson quit the railroad when he got a role in a traveling play and later began working nights as a taxi driver and in other jobs while going to auditions by day.In 1968 he married Susan Greene, a manager with Trans World Airlines.",

raised, marked by a certain shared disorientation and the sense that home is everywhere and nowhere at once.\nIt\u2019s for this reason that the Italian director Luca Guadagnino will attempt to unpack one iteration of this experience \u2014 through Fraser, Britney and their five best friends \u2014 in \u201cWe Are Who We Are,\u201d an eight-part series premiering this September on HBO that pulls back the curtain on the experiences of the children of military families abroad and other third-culture kids like them, whose place in the world now feels both more tenuous and important than ever before.ImageJordan Kristine Seam\u00f3n and Grazer in \u201cWe Are Who We Are.\u201dCredit...Yannis Drakoulidis/HBOCoined by the American sociologist Ruth Useem in the 1950s, the term \u201cthird-culture kid\u201d was conceived for expatriate children who spend their formative years overseas, shaped by the multicultural, peripatetic spheres of their parents, many of whom are diplomats, military members or others working in foreign service.\nThey relocate frequently and enroll their children in international schools, exposing them to miniature realms cultivated by peers from nations far and wide, whose customs, languages and mores coalesce, birthing hybrid or \u201cthird\u201d cultures that are globe-spanning, diverse, highly empathic and oftentimes difficult to translate outside these environments.Perhaps because this life is characteristically slippery, it\u2019s struggled to become clearly defined in the culture, even in fictional stories, suited though they are to crafting imagined worlds.\nStill, there are characters that have managed to catch hold, the complexities of their placelessness often anchored to more universal quandaries: Elio Perlman, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in Guadagnino\u2019s 2017 film adaptation of Andr\u00e9 Aciman\u2019s \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d is one such example; a trilingual adolescent reared in the university orbit between the United States and Northern Italy \u2014 his father is from the former, his mother the latter \u2014 he casts his American and European identities on and off with a kind of begrudging ease, lording them over his father\u2019s visiting graduate student, Oliver (Armie Hammer), on some days, while on others he\u2019s consumed by a sort of languid estrangement from everyone around him, retreating into himself.\nThough the story is propelled forward by the unfurling of muffled desire and fleeting boyhood, it\u2019s hard not to notice how a defined cultural identity \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 inevitably underscores Elio\u2019s coming-of-age, as he pursues different versions of himself in different relationships: in English with Oliver, in French and Italian with his girlfriend Marzia and in all three with his parents, code-switching in what feels like a futile attempt to stitch together facets of a fractured self.ImageTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet in \u201cCall Me By Your Name.\u201dCredit...Sony Pictures Classics, via Associated PressOf course, how Elio conveys this onscreen may have more to do with Guadagnino himself, who has long constructed his complex, layered characters partly in his own image.\nSo, I always try to keep in mind what I could have been experiencing during my youth in all these places through the prism of these complex stories I tell.\u201dIf asked, any third-culture kid will tell you that shape-shifting \u2014 rousing one of the many selves stacked within you to best suit the place you\u2019re in \u2014 becomes a necessary survival skill, a sort of feigned fitting in that allows you to relate something of yourself to nearly everyone you meet.\nAs someone raised between New York and the diplobrat bubble of an international school in New Delhi, India, where friends would come and go every few years, I became adept at calibrating myself to find the points of connection between us, able to relate equally to someone from South Korea, Iceland, Japan, Italy or Jamaica, in many cases more so than to other Indian Americans whose lives, at least on paper, read closer to my own.\nAnd because our stories couldn\u2019t be gleaned from our outward appearances, accents or possessions, we all came humble to the table, open and permeable and ready to barter the surfaces of our souls: our learnings, our languages, our cuisines, our clothing.While all of this contributed, certainly, to feeling perennially adrift (according to multiple studies by Useem and others, much as they may try, adult TCKs never wholly repatriate culturally), it blotted the sensation of feeling like we\u2019d \u201cgrown up at an angle to everywhere and everyone,\u201d as the writer Pico Iyer \u2014 of Indian parentage, raised between England and California, who now lives between the latter and Japan \u2014 told me during a recent phone conversation.\nIn his own work, Iyer has spent a lifetime examining this feeling and others that result from cultural crisscrossing, both out in the world in \u201cVideo Night in Kathmandu,\u201d a 1988 collection of essays which examines the unlikely cultural points at which East and West meet across Asia \u2014 Japan\u2019s affinity for baseball, say, or the Philippines\u2019 obsession with country and western music \u2014 and then in \u201cThe Global Soul,\u201d written twelve years later, which studied, conversely, the crisscrossings that take place within.\nBut also, because I didn\u2019t have that external way of defining myself, I had to be really rigorous and directed in grounding myself internally, through my values and loyalties and to the people I hold closest to me.\u201dImageOthers have found freedom in the same, becoming natural shape-shifters whose value systems transcend borders to instill a sense of home.\nThe most famous example is probably Barack Obama, whose 1995 memoir, \u201cDreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance,\u201d whirls through Jakarta, Seattle, Kenya and Hawaii with unsparing analysis of what it means to belong to multiple worlds and therefore to none of them, but to find, later, that refuge lies in the space between all of them \u2014 and in the ability to unite not just your worlds but others\u2019, too.\nAs much as the third-culture experience is clouded by the fog of liminality, it\u2019s informed also by the ability to define oneself on one\u2019s own terms, difficult as that endeavor may be in the face of increasing scrutiny toward globalism and those formed by it.The presentation of this \u2014 dazzling and dressed up \u2014 is what makes \u201cWe Are Who We Are\u201d thrilling to watch.\n\u201cWhen you grow up this way, there is a feeling of being lost, but to be lost is also to be open,\u201d Guadagnino says.\nIn the late Kobe Bryant\u2019s 2018 book \u201cThe Mamba Mentality,\u201d which offers a glimpse into his childhood years in Reggio Emilia, Italy, he discusses the importance of having learned how to navigate a new culture with compassion.\nAnd when he died in Los Angeles, he died in Reggio Emilia, too, where they mourned a version of him America never knew, except for the Italian names he had chosen for his daughters: Gianna, Natalia, Bianka and Capri.ImageOf course, not all depictions of third-culture life have been so uplifting.\nWithout proper context, it can appear as if they need too much and require a sort of excess to keep them perpetually moving, making it hard to divorce third-culture life from that of overt wealth and privilege, or an indifference to local customs.\nWhen the central character, Beck \u2014 a timid, hopeful writer played by Elizabeth Lail \u2014 meets her, she looks her up and down and smirks before asking, \u201cJersey, right?\u201d and runs off to take a call from her grandparents in Swedish.\nIn the third-culture writer Stephanie LaCava\u2019s forthcoming novel, \u201cThe Superrationals,\u201d which dives into the torrid waters of the international art world, the protagonist Mathilde, raised between the U.S. and France, is ridiculed relentlessly by \u201cthe girls,\u201d a catty clique of gallery insiders who dislike her for all the ways in which she\u2019s different (\u201cWhat is that name?\u201d they ask.\nAnd in 2010\u2019s \u201cSidewalks,\u201d a razor-sharp collection of essays about the failures of finding home in lived experiences and written ones alike, Valeria Luiselli \u2014 the author of the 2019 novel \u201cLost Children Archive\u201d and the daughter of a Mexican diplomat formed by an upbringing in Costa Rica, South Korea, India and South Africa \u2014 sarcastically comments on her own selection of Mexico as \u201cher country,\u201d driven mostly by cynicism and \u201ca sort of spiritual laziness than an authentic act of faith.\u201d She admits she\u2019s never felt true allegiance to anywhere she\u2019s lived, knowing only that she must continue roaming.But all these stories, of course, predate the precarious state we find ourselves in today, when borders are clamping down in domino effect, driven in part by the Covid-19 pandemic, itself a case against globalism and the speed at which interconnectedness can burn it all down, imperiling not only our ability to travel but limiting those who find selfhood in marginal spaces, whose stories underscore the urgency of seeing the world as one.\nOne might look to Kamala Harris \u2014 who, born to Jamaican and Indian parents, often discusses her ability to consider multiple sides \u2014 or Obama before her.",

forging unexpected bonds from their shared misery.\nIt sounds like the set-up for a crushingly typical TV sitcom, but \u201cCommunity\u201d is anything but; over its six tempestuous seasons, the creator, Dan Harmon, and his inventive writers, turned the classroom laugher into a \u201cbracingly funny\u201d and slyly surreal blend of sketch comedy, science fiction and meta-television \u2014 while simultaneously creating the kind of complicated but sympathetic characters and delicate relationships it seemed too cool to indulge.\n(\u201cCommunity\u201d fans will also enjoy Harmon\u2019s

Korean director Bong Joon Ho, who previously smuggled trenchant class commentary into genre movies like \u201cThe Host\u201d and \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d takes a more direct route with this story of a household of grifters who smooth-talk their way into the home of a clueless upper-class family.\nWhat begins as a clever con comedy turns into something much darker (and bloodier), a \u201cbrilliant and deeply unsettling\u201d examination of privilege and power, orchestrated by a filmmaker working at the top of his craft; the results were thrilling enough to win not only the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, but the first best picture Oscar for a film not in English.\nBourdain\u2019s willingness to go wherever the journey takes him gives his show an inspired unpredictability and infectious energy.Watch it on Hulu.ImageLakeith Stanfield, left, and Donald Glover in \u201cAtlanta.\u201dCredit...Guy D\u2019Alema/FX\u2018Atlanta\u2019 (2016-present)In a scant two seasons, Donald Glover\u2019s FX comedy/drama has established itself as a true force in modern television \u2014 thoughtful, peculiar, cinematic, relentlessly entertaining.\nThe supporting cast is top-notch, with Brian Tyree Henry, Lakeith Stanfield and Zazie Beetz as nuanced characters interpreted with fierce precision, but the show is most dazzling for its tonal improvisations; it feels like Glover and company can go anywhere, at any time, and the results are exhilarating.\n(Pamela Adlon\u2019s acclaimed \u201cBetter Things,\u201d also from FX, is a similarly personality-driven comedy/drama.)Watch

boasted as many problems as Michael Bluth\u2019s: His father is in prison, his mother is blissfully out of touch, one brother is a blowhard, the other seems to be from another planet, his sister is a dime-store Gwyneth Paltrow and his son is in love with his cousin.\nHulu is only streaming the original three seasons of the series (Netflix financed, and thus hosts, its revival), but these are the best ones anyway.Watch it on Hulu.ImageA scene from Christopher Guest\u2019s \u201cWaiting for Guffman.\u201dCredit...Suzanne Tenner/Castle Rock Entertainment, via Alamy\u2018Waiting for Guffman\u2019

including Eugene Levy, Fred Willard, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Parker Posey and Bob Balaban \u2014 for this gentle satire of community theater and small-town life.\nGuest stars as Corky St. Clair, the flamboyant and ambitious writer and director of the musical revue celebrating the sesquicentennial of Blaine, Mo.; he (and, by extension, his cast and crew) become convinced that it\u2019s good enough for Broadway, and that\u2019s when the trouble starts.\n(Guest and company\u2019s follow-up, \u201cBest in Show,\u201d is also on Hulu.)Watch it on Hulu.ImageKyle MacLachlan in \u201cTwin

their laughs, or their heart \u2014 but then again, few television series are as special as \u201cCheers.\u201d Set in a Boston bar owned and tended by a former baseball star and recovering alcoholic (Ted Danson, in the role that understandably made him a star), \u201cCheers\u201d took the conventions of the character-driven hangout sitcom and perfected them.\nThanks to consistently razor-sharp writing and a flawless ensemble cast, the result was \u201cpure comedy that was sophisticated but not pretentious.\u201d Running 275 episodes (without a clunker in the bunch), \u201cCheers\u201d has gone on to charm subsequent generations of viewers, who have found it as comforting and reliable as \u2026 well, as a trip to the neighborhood watering hole.\n(The show\u2019s long-running spinoff series \u201cFrasier\u201d is also on Hulu.)Watch it on Hulu.ImageA scene from \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers.\u201dCredit...Fox\u2018Bob\u2019s Burgers\u2019 (2011 \u2014 present)Though separated by nearly two decades, \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d is something of a \u201cCheers\u201d for the 21st century \u2014 television comfort food, centering on a neighborhood mainstay and the weirdos who float through its doors (though this show\u2019s characters are allowed to veer into even stranger territory by the animated format).\nOur critic compared it to a go-to restaurant, \u201creliably good, visit after visit.\u201d (\u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d fans may also enjoy \u201cKing of the Hill.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageKirsten Dunst in \u201cMelancholia.\u201dCredit...Magnolia

pace.\nShe came into her own as a performer over the show\u2019s seven seasons, with the help of an unbeatable ensemble cast: Jane Krakowski as the show\u2019s uproariously vain star, Tracy Morgan as a gleefully hedonistic superstar brought in to boost ratings, Jack McBrayer as the delightfully na\u00efve network page, and (especially) Alec Baldwin as the gruff and cynical network executive in

teen horror/comedy, launching midseason on a network no one had heard of.\nBut from the ashes of the (vastly compromised, it\u2019s said) 1992 feature film came Joss Whedon\u2019s reimagined and recalibrated seven-season triumph, which slyly conflated the conventions of supernatural horror and high school life, and asked which was truly the fiery hellscape.\n(Whedon\u2019s short-lived but much-loved space opera \u201cFirefly\u201d is also available on Hulu.)Watch it on Hulu.ImageHomer and Lisa in \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201dCredit...Fox\u2018The Simpsons\u2019 (1989-present)There was little reason to expect much from this cartoon comedy, which the then-nascent Fox network spun off from the animated interstitials of \u201cThe Tracey Ullman Show.\u201d But this series, which our critic deemed \u201crefreshingly different,\u201d became the longest-running fiction series in television history, with a jaw-dropping 30 seasons on the books.\nNot all are great (nothing lasts forever, folks), but particularly in its early, subversive seasons, \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d is a whip-smart, lightning-paced mixture of social commentary, pop culture burlesque and anti-\u201cCosby Show\u201d family comedy.\n(Creator Matt Groening\u2019s follow-up series \u201cFuturama\u201d is also streaming on Hulu.)Watch it on Hulu.ImageA scene from \u201cChicken Run.\u201dCredit...DreamWorks Pictures\u2018Chicken Run\u2019 (2000)Aardman Animations, the British stop-motion studio behind the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit shorts, made its feature debut with this delightful cross between barnyard farce and prison escape caper, in which a headstrong hen enlists a cocky circus rooster to help her and her friends flee their henhouse before the evil farmer turns them into pies.\nOur critic called it \u201cimmensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film.\u201d (For more stop-motion family fun, stream LAIKA\u2019s \u201cMissing Link.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageFrom

Pictures\u2018If Beale Street Could Talk\u2019 (2018)Barry Jenkins followed up the triumph of his Oscar-winning \u201cMoonlight\u201d with this \u201canguished and mournful\u201d adaptation of James Baldwin\u2019s 1974 novel.\nBut it\u2019s also a love story between two African-Americans in 1960s Harlem, and the delicacy with which the filmmaker threads in the troubles of that time, and the injustice that ultimately tears his main characters apart, is heart-wrenching.\nMasterly performances abound \u2014 particularly from Regina King, who won an Oscar for her complex, layered portrayal of a mother on a mission.Watch it on Hulu.ImageFrom left, Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, Jerry Seinfeld and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in \u201cSeinfeld.\u201dCredit...NBC\u2018Seinfeld\u2019 (1989-1998)Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David\u2019s nine-season ensemble sitcom was, famously, a show \u201cabout nothing,\u201d but that label is deceptively simplistic.\n(And also, subtly, it\u2019s about becoming one yourself.) The four actors at the show\u2019s center were a Marx Brothers of the \u201990s, a finely-tuned comedy team whose gifts and timing complemented each other with precision, and the writing \u2014 chock-full of idioms and idiosyncrasies that have fully penetrated the American vernacular \u2014 is as sharp and uproarious as ever.\n(The show\u2019s spiritual successor, the darkly funny \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\u201d is also on Hulu.)Watch it on Hulu.ImageBuzz Aldrin in \u201cApollo 11,\u201d a documentary by Todd Douglas Miller.Credit...Neon CNN Films\u2018Apollo 11\u2019 (2019)The first manned voyage to the moon is a subject not exactly avoided by filmmakers, nonfiction and otherwise; the particulars of that 1969 mission have been so exhaustively documented and dramatized, it seemed impossible that Todd Douglas Miller\u2019s 50th anniversary feature would offer anything new.\nThe results, our critic wrote, are \u201centirely awe-inspiring.\u201dWatch it on Hulu.ImageZack Mulligan, left, and Keire Johnson in the documentary \u201cMinding the Gap.\u201dCredit...Hulu\u2018Minding the Gap\u2019 (2018)Bing Liu was nominated for a best documentary Oscar for this, his debut feature, a candid and sometimes agonizingly intimate portrait of his loose crew of skateboarding pals.\nBut it was, observing and chronicling their lives for years on end \u2014 and as they got older, Liu used their comfort to eavesdrop on difficult conversations and extraordinary confessions, weaving what A.O. Scott called \u201ca rich, devastating essay on race, class and manhood in 21st-century America.\u201d (Admirers of this intimate documentary may also enjoy \u201cThe Wolfpack\u201d and \u201cHoneyland.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageDaniel J.\n(The show\u2019s influence is keenly felt in Bochco\u2019s later \u201cNYPD Blue.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageBeanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever in Olivia Wilde\u2019s directorial debut, \u201cBooksmart.\u201dCredit...Annapurna Pictures\u2018Booksmart\u2019 (2019)Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein are the delightful duo \u2014 funny, prickly and plausible \u2014 at the center of this \u201cfast, brainy, nasty-but-nice teenage comedy\u201d from the actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde, which both embraces the conventions of the John Hughes-style high school movie and shrewdly subverts them.\n(For more character-driven comedy/drama, check out \u201cI, Tonya\u201d and \u201cSupport the Girls.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageAlan Alda, Wayne Rogers and Loretta Swit in \u201cM*A*S*H.\u201dCredit...CBS\u2018M*A*S*H\u2019 (1972-1983)Robert Altman\u2019s hit 1970 antiwar comedy didn\u2019t seem like a slam-dunk for television adaptation, thanks to its raw style and bawdy humor.\n(If you\u2019re looking for a more serious medical series, stream the \u201990s fave \u201cER.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageFrom left, Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler and Chris Pratt in \u201cParks and Recreation.\u201dCredit...Colleen Hayes/NBC\u2018Parks and Recreation\u2019 (2009-2015)Greg Daniels and Michael Schur\u2019s follow-up to the U.S. version of \u201cThe Office\u201d took some time to find its own identity; its mockumentary style and eager-to-please protagonist made it seem, at first blush, like an \u201cOffice\u201d knockoff.\nBut it soon established itself as \u201ccharming and funny in its own right and in its own way\u201d: a gentle (sometimes even whimsical) small-town ensemble comedy, powered by the quirks and idiosyncrasies of its finely-tuned characters and the sheer comic force of the leading lady, Amy Poehler.\n(Schur\u2019s follow-up \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d and the similarly styled \u201cSuperstore\u201d are also available on Hulu.)Watch it on Hulu.ImageKristen Bell in \u201cVeronica Mars.\u201dCredit...Scott Garfield/Warner Bros.\u2018Veronica Mars\u2019 (2004-2019)The creator Rob Thomas ingeniously fused the conventions of hard-boiled private eye noir with high school drama for this clever, moody and frequently funny three-season marvel (subsequently revived for a 2014 movie and a recent fourth season), which our critics deemed one of the best TV dramas this side of \u2018The Sopranos.\u2019 It also made a star out of Kristen Bell, who seamlessly veers from tough to vulnerable as the title character, a postmodern Nancy Drew who answers phones at her dad\u2019s investigation agency and explores the seamy underbelly of her upper-class seaside resort town.\n(If you like the neo-noir vibe of this one, check out \u201cGemini\u201d;

you\u2019re never quite sure if you\u2019re going to get a breezy chase scene or a raw, emotional verbal duet.\n(Executive producer Shawn Ryan\u2019s \u201cThe Shield\u201d is also available on Hulu.)Watch it on Hulu.ImageJulian Dennison, left, and Sam Neill in \u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople.\u201dCredit...The Orchard\u2018Hunt for the Wilderpeople\u2019 (2016)This riotous, high-spirited, \u201ccharming and funny\u201d family comedy could have been played straight, as a Disney-style, kid-friendly adventure yarn.\nSam Neill amps up the gruff tenderness that made his turn in \u201cJurassic Park\u201d so memorable, but the real find here is Julian Dennison, a young leading man so unlikely yet so charismatic that the rest of the movie bends around him.Watch it on Hulu.ImageA scene from \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201dCredit...CBS\u2018The Twilight Zone\u2019 (1959-1964)Rod Serling\u2019s innovative, influential, unforgettable anthology series married the tropes of science fiction with the humanism of morality tales, using the social shifts and rampant paranoia of the Cold War era to tell stories both wildly fantastic and uncomfortably familiar.\n\u201cWhile he hosted weekly visits to other planets and alternate universes,\u201d our critic writes, \u201cSerling asked his viewers to question authority, innovation and the role of faith in their lives.\u201dWatch it on Hulu.ImageLeonard Nimoy in the original \u201cStar Trek.\u201dCredit...CBS\u2018Star Trek\u2019 (1966-1969)Serling\u2019s contemporary Gene Roddenberry likewise used the conventions of genre fiction to tell strikingly contemporary stories about the human condition.\n(The follow-up series \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d is also on Hulu, as is the similarly beloved \u201cThe X-Files.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageAretha Franklin in \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201dCredit...Amazing Grace Movie Llc/EPA, via Shutterstock\u2018Amazing Grace\u2019 (2018)Over two nights in January of 1971, Aretha Franklin, a gospel choir and a live audience gathered at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts to record \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d her soul-stirring, best-selling, widely acclaimed gospel album.\nWesley Morris called it, simply, \u201cone of the great music films.\u201d (Music and movies also pair movingly in the films \u201cWild Rose\u201d and \u201cLove & Mercy.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageA 2001 \u201cCelebrity Jeopardy\u201d sketch on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201dCredit...Mary Ellen Matthews/NBC\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 (1975-present)Cultural constants are in short supply, but it seems like we\u2019ll always have NBC\u2019s impossibly long-running late-night variety program, which has been skewering politicians, the news media and the foibles of daily life for 45 seasons (and counting).\nHulu doesn\u2019t offer all of them; the service takes a giant leap from Season 5 to Season 30, which means you don\u2019t get the glory days of Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, Mike Myers and several other MVPs. But there\u2019s plenty of gold to choose from \u2014 particularly those first five years, featuring the original, comically peerless ensemble and such immortal characters as the Coneheads, the Blues Brothers, and Roseanne Roseannadanna.\n(For more sketch comedy, check out \u201cKey & Peele.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageMary Kay Place in "Diane."Credit...Tribeca Film Festival, via Associated Press\u2018Diane\u2019 (2019)Mary Kay Place has carved out a remarkable career as a valuable supporting player (including memorable turns in \u201cThe Big Chill,\u201d \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d and \u201cGirl, Interrupted\u201d), but she was rarely given the opportunity to show what she could do in a leading role.\nThe writer and director Kent Jones changed that with this acclaimed independent drama, featuring Place as a prototypical good citizen who spends her days volunteering in her small town, supporting friends and family in various states of duress and contemplating her own mortality.\nOur critic called it \u201ca rich and tender study of a woman hollowed out by remorse.\u201d (Admirers of this intimate character study may also enjoy \u201cLittle Woods.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageValerie Harper, left, and Mary Tyler Moore on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show.\u201dCredit...CBS, via Getty Images\u2018The Mary Tyler Moore Show\u2019 (1970-1977)You can find the DNA of this sophisticated, influential seven-season classic in everything from \u201c30 Rock\u201d to \u201cThe Office\u201d to \u201cSex and the City.\u201d Moore sparkles as a newly single working woman making her way in the big city of Minneapolis, where she spends her days in a bustling TV newsroom and her nights trying to reassemble her personal life.\nMidway through its run, our critic wrote, \u201cConsistently tight writing and good acting have made this situation comedy the best of its kind in the history of American television.\u201d He wasn\u2019t wrong.\n(Moore\u2019s other beloved, long-running sitcom, \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d is also on Hulu, as is co-star Betty White\u2019s \u201cThe Golden Girls.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageCarrie Coon in \u201cFargo.\u201dCredit...Matthias Clamer/FX\u2018Fargo\u2019 (2014-present)Noah Hawley\u2019s television adaptation of the Coen Brothers\u2019 1996 Oscar winner sounded like a sure-fire failure.\nYet Hawley\u2019s series, a seasonal anthology \u2014 each year telling a new quirky crime story, in a different time period \u2014 succeeds by taking the entire Coen canon as inspiration (one of the show\u2019s many pleasures is spotting the connections to all of their films) and telling stories that fit snugly into that same, cockeyed universe.\nOur critics called its first season \u201coddly winning,\u201d Season 2 \u201csublime,\u201d and Season 3 \u201can expertly made meta-concoction.\u201d (\u201cFargo\u201d fans may also enjoy FX\u2019s \u201cJustified,\u201d another wry, witty neo-Western.)Watch it on Hulu.ImageMya Taylor, left, and Kitana Kiki Rodriguez in \u201cTangerine.\u201dCredit...Magnolia Pictures\u2018Tangerine\u2019 (2015)Shot on the fly in real locations with smartphones and a cast of mostly first-time actors, this \u201cfast, raucously funny comedy about love and other misadventures\u201d from the director Sean Baker (\u201cThe Florida Project\u201d) is a vibrant and heartfelt story of life on the fringe.\n(Indie drama fans will also want to watch \u201cThe Nightingale.\u201d)Watch it on Hulu.ImageFrom left, Kyle Chandler and Zach Gilford in the TV series \u201cFriday Night Lights.\u201dCredit...Bill Records/NBC\u2018Friday Night Lights\u2019 (2006-2011)When this series adaptation of the 2004 feature film \u2014 itself an adaptation of Buzz Bissinger\u2019s nonfiction book \u2014 debuted on NBC in 2006, our critic led her review with a succinct proclamation: \u201cLord, is \u2018Friday Night Lights\u2019 good.\u201d Over the five seasons that followed, this heart-rending drama, set in the world of small-town high school football (though not, in any traditional sense, solely about that world), taught lessons, complicated assumptions, and developed some of the indelible characters in modern television \u2014 chief among them Kyle Chandler as the idealistic and committed Coach Taylor and Connie Britton as his no-nonsense wife.\n(For more character-driven drama, check out \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d and \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d;

        "Attributing the rise in inflation to supply-side frictions, Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian has exuded confidence that retail inflation will come down in the days ahead with the easing of lockdowns.According to the government data, retail inflation rose to 6.93 per cent in July, mainly driven by rising prices of food items like vegetables, pulses, meat and fish.However, wholesale price-based inflation declined 0.58 per cent in July, even as food items turned costlier.\u201cIf you look at inflation\u2026it\u2019s primarily because of those supply-side frictions, but as local lockdowns are actually being reduced, these frictions should basically go down,\u201d he told PTI.\u201cOverall, the difference between wholesale and retail inflation is primarily due to supply-side factors which should decrease and therefore going forward even the retail inflation should ease,\u201d Subramanian said.There are fears that retail inflation would remain at an elevated level during the rest of the year limiting the scope for the RBI to further ease the benchmark interest rate.The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by the RBI Governor has been given the mandate to maintain annual retail inflation at 4 per cent until March 31, 2021, with an upper tolerance of 6 per cent and a lower tolerance of 2 per cent.Retail inflation so far has been in the tolerance range of MPC except for breach in July.\nIn June, retail inflation was 6.09 per cent.At the same time, WPI inflation in June was at (-) 1.81 per cent, while for the month of May and April it was (-) 3.37 per cent and (-) 1.57 per cent respectively.As far as growth is concerned, India\u2019s economy suffered its worst slump on record in April-June, with the gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by 23.9 per cent as the coronavirus-related lockdowns weighed on the already-declining consumer demand and investment.The GDP contraction in the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy compared with 3.1 per cent growth in the preceding January-March quarter and 5.2 per cent expansion in the same period a year back.During the April-June quarter, agriculture was the lone bright spot, growing by 3.4 per cent.\nFinancial services \u2014 the biggest component of India\u2019s dominant services sector \u2014 shrank 5.3 per cent, while trade, hotels, transport and communication declined 47 per cent.Manufacturing shrank 39.3 per cent, construction contracted 50.3 per cent, mining output fell 23.3 per cent, and electricity and gas segment dropped 7 per cent.The latest print of factory output is also not encouraging as the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) contracted by 10.4 per cent in July mainly due to lower output of manufacturing, mining and power generation.\nClick here to join our channel and stay updated with the latest Biz news and updates.HomeECONOMYRetail inflation to come down with easing of lockdowns Chief Economic&nbspAdviser",

This was an initiative of the government to help gencos to remain afloat.The liquidity infusion package is set to increase to Rs 1.2 lakh crore by this month end.\nNow the boards of the two state run non-banking finance firms would have to approve hike in the package.Discoms in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu account for the major portion of dues to power gencos, data showed.Overdues of independent power producers amount to 33.78 per cent of the total overdue of Rs 1,29,490 crore of discoms in July.\nAlso get Live BSE/NSE Stock Prices, latest NAV of Mutual Funds, Best equity funds, Top Gainers, Top Losers on Financial Express.",

        "Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday rolled out a smart ration card scheme for providing subsidised foodgrains to 1.41 crore beneficiaries in the state.\nHe also announced a separate state-funded scheme to provide subsidised rations to nine lakh beneficiaries not covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).\nWith this, the total number of beneficiaries in the state will go up to 1.50 crore, the chief minister said while rolling out the smart ration card scheme under which 37.5 lakh cards will be distributed to the eligible beneficiaries this month.The CM said the Centre has capped the maximum number of beneficiaries to 1.41 crore and, despite repeated requests, has not agreed to provide subsidised rations to the deserving nine lakh people not covered under the NFSA.\nHis government has therefore decided to cover all such left out eligible persons under a state-funded scheme, details of which will be announced shortly, he said.\nThe scheme empowers the beneficiary to get his entitled quota of foodgrains from any ration depot in the state of Punjab, he said.\nPointing to the melting glaciers and the receding groundwater level in the state, he said the situation is critical and the state simply cannot afford to give any water to other states.In a symbolic gesture, the CM handed over the smart ration cards to four beneficiaries here, after which all ministers and MLAs distributed cards in their respective districts and constituencies, as per a government release here.\nEarlier, state Food minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said the state government had weeded out ghost beneficiaries and undeserving people who were being provided subsidies by the erstwhile SAD-BJP regime at the cost of genuine beneficiaries, he added.\nThe Smart cards, said Ashu, will enable the beneficiaries to take ration from any shop, thus ending the monopoly of the ration depots.\nBio-metrics of the cardholder will be matched with the data stored in a chip on the smart ration card to prevent any fraudulent transfer of food grains, he said.\nAlso get Live BSE/NSE Stock Prices, latest NAV of Mutual Funds, Best equity funds, Top Gainers, Top Losers on Financial Express.",

        "Equally disastrous is the contraction in the economy that has happened due to the spread of the virus which prompted governments to resort to prolonged lockdown.The stringency index coined by Oxford University, measuring the relationship between the intensity of the lockdown and loss of economic activity, has put India in a comfortable position so far as fatality rate is concerned at 1.78 against 3.0 in US, 5.3 in China, 10.1 in France, 3.1 in Brazil and 4.2 in Indonesia.\nConversely however, the contraction in GDP in April-June of FY21 in India is (-) 23.9, US (-9.1), France (-18.9), Brazil (-11.4), China (+3.2) and Indonesia (-5.4).\nAlthough the fatality rate should be the most relevant indicator of successful fight against the virus, the adverse impact on economic growth has to be taken up with equally stern steps of reviving the economy.For India, the first quarter of the current fiscal was predominated by prolonged lockdown as the government drew up a stimulus package with a combination of massive relief measures by way of direct transfer of funds, free provision of foodgrains for the poor, enhancement of liquidity for the MSMEs and a series of reforms in various sectors (real estate, affordable housing) to attract private investment.As the country passed the first month of Q2 in FY21, it is interesting to look at some of the positive elements.\nThe resultant growth in rural income was evident in increasing rural construction of houses, other buildings and roads, higher consumption of fertilisers leading to a higher sales and registration for tractors and two-wheelers.The second good indicator is rising toll collection and increased freight earning by Railways.\nThe speed of freight trains has reached 46 kmph which is the net result of Dedicated Freight Corridor programme.During April-August \u201920, the ministry of roads and highways has constructed 3,181 km of national highways against a target of 2,771 km at the daily rate of 21.2 km which is, however, marginally lower as compared to FY20 and FY19.\nBy bringing a much-needed change in Model Concession agreement in BOT model to be reassessed in every five years as against every 10 years now would bring certainty in cash flow and mitigate the risk of private investment in road sector.The third good indicator is provided by commercial mining.\nThe Coal India would be investing another Rs 25,000 crore in 2022-26 period for other Coal gasification capacities.Fourthly, the GST collection has gone up from Rs 43,000 crore in April\u201920 to Rs 86,449 crore in August\u201920, nearly 88% of the collection in last year.\nAlthough the June\u201920 data indicates a 158% rise in manufacturing indices compared to April\u201920, the prolonged lockdown, the poor scale of investment activities in infra and construction segments and lack of spending had undermined the rise in production in capital, intermediate and consumer goods segments.\nThe forex reserves at $541.43 bn as on August 28, 2020, is quite satisfactory and indicates an optimistic foreign investor sentiment towards India.In Q1FY21, the PFCE has dropped by nearly 27% against a 5.5% growth in Q1 of last year signifying a major fall in discretionary spending by private sector as well as by household.\nHowever, GFCE, the government\u2019s revenue expenditure, net of interest payments and major subsidies has risen by as high as 16.4% in Q1, against 6.2% growth in last year thereby enhancing its share at 19.1% of GDP in the current quarter.\nThe list of fresh opportunities in specific projects to attract private investment and FDI shown in NIP online and proposed formation of Development Finance Institutions (DFI) are steps in the right direction to spruce up GFCF.The author is DG, Institute of Steel Development and Growth(Views expressed are personal)        Do you know What is  Cash Reserve Ratio\u00a0(CRR), Finance\u00a0Bill, Fiscal Policy in\u00a0India, Expenditure\u00a0Budget, Customs\u00a0Duty?\nAlso get Live BSE/NSE Stock Prices, latest NAV of Mutual Funds, Best equity funds, Top Gainers, Top Losers on Financial Express.",

        "However, the question is how long would they tread the path; they may have already started reining in spending, given that the pandemic is burning a big hole in revenues.Despite liberal transfers by the Centre from the divisible tax pool, tax revenues of states declined more than fifth year-on-year during April-July, but their expenditures seem to have grown faster than the year-ago period.A review of the budgets of ten states by FE showed their combined expenditure in April-July grew 7% on year, compared with a rise of just 3% a year ago.\nThese states\u2019 tax revenue slipped 21% on year during the first four months of the current fiscal.The Centre\u2019s net tax revenue fell a steep 40% in April-July, but it kept the pace of budgetary expenditure at 11%, only marginally lower than 13.2% budgeted for FY21.\nHowever, it indeed applied the brakes on spending after meeting the eventuality of the immediate crisis precipitated by the pandemic \u2013 Budgetary expenditure grew just 6% on year in July compared with 46% in June.Of course, the sinking economy requires far higher levels of public expenditure of both capex and non-capex varieties.Among them, the ten states \u2013 Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana, Kerala, Chattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand and Himachal Pradesh \u2013 reported a combined capital expenditure of Rs 36,987 crore in April-July of FY21, which was 19% lower than in the year-ago period.\nIn contrast, the Centre\u2019s capex grew 4% in the first four months of FY21 even though it was much lower than the required rate of 22% to achieve its capex target for this fiscal.Borrowings by these ten states rose a whopping 80% to Rs 1.11 lakh crore in April-July of this fiscal compared with 11% decline a year ago.\u201cGiven that the borrowing limit set by the GoI acts as a soft constraint to the size of the state governments\u2019 fiscal deficits, capital spending may have to be curtailed in aggregate by the states in FY2021 by Rs 1.0-3.4 trillion,\u201d Icra wrote recently.\nThis is after taking into account the anticipated shortfalls in GST compensation and central tax devolution, despite the two options for additional borrowings put forth by the central government for bridging the states\u2019 GST revenue shortfall.For perspective, states\u2019 combined capital expenditure was pegged to increase 29% year-on-year to `5.81 lakh crore in FY20.\nFor a larger set of 14 states, capital expenditure had seen flat growth in the first eleven months of last fiscal (April-February), against a solid 20% growth in the year ago period.Reduction of capex by states would be a drag on the gross domestic product, which various analysts have predicted to contract by roughly 10-15% in FY21.\nIn recent years, public capex has been roughly in the 5:5.5:3.5 ratio among the CPSEs, states (budget) and the Centre (budget).What is more worrisome for the states is that the Centre, which has been liberal by maintaining tax devolution at nearly the FY21 budgeted pace, has started adjusting the extra transfers and this may accentuate in the fourth quarter of FY21.According to Icra, the shareable tax pool may turn out to be Rs 13.4 lakh crore in FY21, 30% lower than the budgeted amount of Rs 19.1 lakh crore.\nThe agency has projected the central tax devolution to the state governments at about Rs 5 lakh crore (after adjusting for Centre\u2019s extra transfers of Rs 48,400 crore in FY20) in FY21, a substantial `2.8 lakh crore lower than the Rs 7.8 lakh crore budgeted.Former chief statistician Pronab Sen has estimated the shortfall in overall tax revenues for the states to be around Rs 4.5 lakh crore in FY21.As per state budgets, their combined fiscal deficit stood at 2.4% of GSDP in FY19, the target (BE) for FY20 was 2.6%, but the deficit must have been significantly higher.\nFY21 will likely see a record spike in the fiscal deficits of both the Centre and states.Icra prognosticates a combined fiscal deficit of a minimum of 4.25% of the GSDP and maximum up to 5.52% of GSDP for states in the current fiscal year, based on an analysis of the two options for state government borrowing in FY21 put forth recently by the Centre (inclusive of reforms based relaxations and those related to compensation for shortfall in protected GST revenues).",

        "The index of industrial production (IIP) dropped 10.4% in July, against a 15.8% (revised) contraction in the previous month, reflecting the impact of an easing of lockdown curbs since June.\nHowever, while the contraction in output narrowed from a record 57.3% in April, the relative recovery since June was milder than expected and pointed to a bumpy road to a sustained and strong recovery.Nevertheless, given the exceptional circumstances, the government earlier highlighted that any comparison with the (year-on-year) growth rates for earlier months would be inappropriate at this juncture.\nSome lockdown-related curbs at the local levels are still intact, which have weighed on manufacturing.Not surprisingly, capital goods output shrank for 19 months in a row, while consumer durables saw a 14th straight month of fall in July.\nWhile consumer durables dropped by 23.6% in July, capital goods saw a 22.8% decline.\nAlthough, consumer non-durables rose (6.7%) for a second straight month in July, the recovery almost halved, suggesting a loss of momentum in corporate re-stocking.Manufacturing contracted 11.1% in July, against a 19.6% fall in the previous month, while mining dropped by 13%, against a 16% decline in the previous month.\nElectricity contracted by 2.5% in July, compared with a 10% fall in June.Aditi Nayar, principal economist at Icra, said: \u201cOver the next three months, while the base effect is favourable given the contraction in industrial output from August-October 2019, the impact of waning pent-up demand, as well as restocking ahead of the festive season remains to be seen.",

        "Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Friday slashed India\u2019s growth projection for the current fiscal to (-) 11.5 per cent, from (-) 4 per cent estimated earlier, saying the economic contraction would be more pronounced due to the lockdown and continued rise in coronavirus cases.The US-based rating agency also projected India\u2019s debt burden to peak at around 90 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal and the Centre\u2019s fiscal deficit to be close to 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product.In the previous fiscal, India\u2019s debt burden was 72 per cent of GDP, while the fiscal deficit stood at 4.6 per cent.India\u2019s GDP contracted by 23.9 per cent year-on-year in the April-June quarter, following the economic impact of the nationwide lockdown measures, which were in place from late March until a phased lifting of restrictions began in June.?\u201cThe collapse in GDP was one of the sharpest among all major G-20 economies.\nWe now expect real GDP to contract by 11.5 per cent in the fiscal year starting April 2020, much weaker than our previous forecast of a 4 per cent contraction,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.It expects growth to rebound to 10.6 per cent in fiscal 2021, reflecting a strong statistical base effect from the low GDP levels of 2020 as economic activity gradually normalises.The sharp decline in growth will result in materially weaker government revenue.\nCombined with increased fiscal expenditure in response to the coronavirus outbreak, this will contribute to a wider general government fiscal deficit, which we now expect to reach 12 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2020, it said.?Moody\u2019s expects the central government and states to run fiscal deficits close to 7.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent of GDP, respectively.\nThis will drive a?substantially higher debt burden, the agency added.It said the economic contraction in 2020 to be more pronounced because of the lockdown and continued rise in coronavirus cases.\u201cAs the number of daily reported coronavirus cases increases, also spreading further outside major urban centres, the possibility of renewed lockdown measures continues to present downside risk to our forecasts.\nEven in the absence of renewed official restrictions outside of designated containment zones, economic uncertainties could weigh on consumer demand and investment.\u201cBeyond the pandemic, we see a risk that growth rebounds more gradually than in other major emerging economies, and remains below our previous expectations, held back by an increasingly impaired financial system, and limited fiscal capacity to provide support,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.It joined the chorus of other global and domestic agencies which have projected double-digit contraction in the Indian economy.Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs and Fitch projected India\u2019s economy to contract 14.8 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively, in the current fiscal.\nDomestic agency Crisil estimated contraction at 9 per cent.Moody\u2019s had in June downgraded India\u2019s sovereign rating to \u2018Baa3\u2032 \u2014 the lowest investment grade \u2014 just a notch above junk status, with a negative outlook.In its credit opinion report on the Indian government, Moody\u2019s said the country\u2019s credit profile is increasingly constrained by low growth, high debt burden and the weak financial system, and these risks have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cMutually reinforcing risks from deeper stresses in the economy and financial system could lead to a more severe and prolonged erosion in fiscal strength, exerting further pressure on the credit profile,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.It said persistent growth challenges ?\ncontinue to constrain the economy\u2019s potential.These structural weaknesses may impair the economy\u2019s recovery from domestic or external shocks to a greater extent than we presently assume.Moreover, the nature of stress among non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) and banks is still being revealed and may prove deeper and broader than we have assessed so far, it added.The materialisation of economic and financial system risks would be mutually reinforcing; a deeper and more prolonged credit crunch would constrain GDP growth further, which would increase pressure on financial institutions\u2019 balance sheets, the agency said.\u201cShould downside risks to growth or the financial system materialise, negative consequences for India\u2019s fiscal strength would follow.\nThe longer the period of relatively subdued growth, the more likely that India\u2019s debt burden will continue to rise.\u201cAnd the materialisation of further contingent liabilities for the government, in the event of renewed financial support to financial institutions, would only add to the debt burden,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.Ruling out a rating upgrade in the near future, Moody\u2019s said the outlook on India\u2019s rating could be changed to stable if economic developments and policy actions were to raise confidence that real and nominal growth will rise to sustainably higher rates than it projects.Measures that enhance financial stability by strengthening the supervision, regulation and capitalisation of the financial sector would support such a move.",

        'Ex-Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major have urged MPs to reject the "shameful" attempt to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.The two have accused the government of "embarrassing" the UK by seeking the power to change the details of a treaty agreed last year with the EU.MPs will begin debating the contentious Internal Market Bill on Monday.A senior minister said the ex-PMs weren\'t "close" to the process and the UK was in a unprecedented situation.Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the powers being sought by ministers to amend aspects of the Northern Ireland Protocol were an "insurance policy" to be used only if attempts to settle differences in other ways failed.The Protocol, a key part of the Withdrawal Agreement signed by both sides last year, is designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland.If the bill becomes law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or "disapply" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal.Writing in the Sunday Times, Sir John and Mr Blair - former Conservative and Labour prime ministers respectively - said the government\'s actions were "irresponsible, wrong in principle and dangerous in practice"."It raises questions that go far beyond the impact on Ireland, the peace process and negotiations for a trade deal - crucial though they are.\nIt questions the very integrity of our nation," they said.The former leaders, both vehement opponents of Brexit, said that respecting treaty obligations was "just as important" as domestic law, and called for MPs to reject the legislation."As the world looks on aghast at the UK - the word of which was once accepted as inviolable - this government\'s action is shaming itself and embarrassing our nation," they added.By Leila Nathoo, political correspondentTony Blair and Sir John Major say Boris Johnson knew the full consequences of the Brexit divorce deal he struck with Brussels last year - that new barriers to trade would arise between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nLess than a year later, the IRA called its first ceasefire.It helped pave the way for all-party talks which culminated with the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998 when Tony Blair was in No 10 - a deal that is widely seen as marking the effective end of Northern Ireland\'s "Troubles".\nThe EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month.The Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, whose party opposed the Withdrawal Agreement, said Mr Blair and Sir John were talking "utter bunkum".He said the former leaders should be focusing on the risk of a "trade border" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and the damage this would do to NI\'s economy."The suggestion by the hero of the peace process brigade that the bill rips apart the Belfast Agreement is complete and utter bunkum without any factual basis," he said."They need to explain how making it easier for Northern Ireland to do business with our biggest market undermines the Belfast Agreement.',

        'More than 30 people have been killed by wildfires that are sweeping through US West Coast states, officials say.Dozens of people are missing in Oregon alone, with one emergency official saying the state should be preparing for a "mass fatality incident".Fires have been raging in Oregon, California and Washington for three weeks, burning millions of acres of land and destroying thousands of homes.Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes.Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden warned on Saturday that "climate change poses an imminent, existential threat to our way of life" and  accused President Donald Trump, a climate sceptic, of denying "that reality".Mr Trump, who is due to visit California on Monday to be briefed on the latest situation, blames the wildfires on poor forest management.The fires have now scorched an area of land the size of New Jersey, officials say.The smoke pollution from the wildfires has left Oregon\'s largest city, Portland, with the worst air quality in the world, followed by San Francisco and Seattle, according to IQAir.com.In Oregon, where firefighters are battling 16 large blazes, 40,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders.Oregon\'s Office of Emergency Management (OEM) says the fires have killed 10 people, but officials warn the final death toll could be much higher.Oregon\'s Fire Marshal Jim Walker resigned on Saturday, shortly after he had been placed on leave amid a personnel investigation.Earlier this week, Governor Kate Brown implored householders to stay out of the fire zones despite reports of looting.\n"Let me assure you that we have the Oregon National Guard and Oregon State Police monitoring the situation and preventing looting," she said.Beatriz Gomez Bolanos, 41, told Reuters news agency of her family\'s frightening drive to safety through fires burning on both sides of their car.\nWe have to start again from nothing, but we are alive," she told the news agency.At least one blaze in Oregon - the Almeda Fire, one of the most destructive in the state - is being treated as suspected arson.In Washington state, firefighters are tackling 15 large fires.\nHis parents remain in a critical condition.Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Friday inspected damage from the North Complex Fire, near Oroville in Northern California."The debate is over, around climate change," Mr Newsom told reporters.\nThis is real and it\'s happening." He acknowledged failings in forest management in recent decades, but added: "That\'s one point, but it\'s not the point." Highlighting the states effort to combat climate change, he said the record heat waves and unprecedented fires were the sort of problems long forecast by scientists.President Trump has argued that California could prevent wildfires if it raked forest floors properly."You\'ve got to clean your forests - there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they\'re like, so flammable," he told a rally last month.\nTwelve bodies have been found so far and a number of people are still missing.California has seen at least 22 deaths in total from fires since 15 August.\nTens of thousands of people are under evacuation orders as 14,800 firefighters continue to combat 28 major fires in the state.Have you been affected by the US wildfires?',

        'KOLKATA: Newly appointed Bengal Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Sunday said his party, together with the Left, will prove to be a "game-changer" in the 2021 Bengal Assembly elections, and warned the ruling TMC and the BJP that the contest won\'t be a cakewalk for them.\nChowdhury, a bitter critic of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, said his focus would be to eat into the vote share of both the TMC and the BJP, and restore secular ethos in the state, which has long been "overshadowed by the sectarian politics" practised by the two parties.\nThe state had last witnessed a hung Assembly during the 1967 polls, when the Bangla Congress and the CPM joined hands to form the government.\nHolding the "appeasement politics" of the TMC government accountable for the rise of the BJP in Bengal, Chowdhury, the leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha, said he would strive to strengthen the party by bringing back old-timers, who have joined opposition camps.\nOver the last few years, however, both the TMC and the BJP have pursued the politics of communal polarisation, and eclipsed the secular ideals that the state has always held dear.\n"I can assure you that the Left Front-Congress tie-up would be a game-changer in Bengal politics.\nUnlike 2019 Lok Sabha polls, I won\'t let the 2021 assembly elections be a cakewalk for the TMC and the BJP, Chowdhury told PTI.\nThe Left-Congress alliance would fight on the plank of development, corruption-free governance," he asserted.\nDuring the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, however, the proposed Congress-CPM alliance fell apart after both the parties were unable to reach an agreement on seat sharing.\nClaiming that the TMC and the BJP are two sides of a coin, he said the state government deliberately pursued appeasement politics to make way for counter polarisation by the saffron camp.\nIt did nothing for the development of the Muslims, but pursued appeasement politics and destroyed the secular fabric of the state," Chowdhury, a vocal detractor of the Mamata Banerjee-led party, said.\nThe ruling party projected itself as the "messiah of the Muslims", and the BJP as the "protector of the Hindus", and they weakened the secular and democratic forces, such as the Congress and the Left, he claimed.\nThe veteran leader said the "dismal performance" of the BJP government at the Centre on various fronts, such as economy, employment and COVID-19 management, would haunt the saffron party in Bengal during the next assembly polls.\nAlong with a surging anti-incumbency wave against the TMC in the state, the winds are also blowing against the BJP due to its bleak performance, nationally," he said.\nAdmitting that there were some gaps in the Left-Congress alliance during the 2016 polls, as it was forged in haste, he said efforts are underway to fix them.\nThe Left-Congress alliance had won 76 seats in the 294-member-strong assembly during the 2016 polls.\nA lot of water, however, has flown under the Howrah Bridge in the last four years, as the BJP made deep inroads and emerged as a prime challenger of the ruling TMC in Bengal, by pushing the traditional opposition parties, the CPM and the Congress, to distant third and fourth positions.\nThe saffron camp reached its all-time high in Bengal politics last year when it stunned pundits by bagging 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state, four less than the ruling TMC, and with a staggering vote share of 41 per cent.',

        "NEW DELHI: BMW X5 is among the very few cars that set the balls rolling for SUVs across the world.\nMore than two decades gone, X5 SAV, Sports Activity Vehicle, as BMW likes to call it, has rewarded owners with a rich feel.\nWe drive to tell you: X5 is bold, imposing, and at the same time bigger in flesh than you think.\nThe new model is longer by 36 mm, taller by 19 mm, and wider 66 mm yet surprisingly it appears smaller than the generation it replaced.\nMove to the sides, the mammoth 20-inch wheels with a 305 section rear tyres add to the chunkiness of the built.\nThanks to the new double-axle adaptive suspension, the ground clearance of X5 can be altered on the go.\nThe reference of the 7 series is obvious, as BMW has tried to match the luxury and comfort inside the cabin.\nThe space inside is generous yet that\u2019s not all you pay Rs 1 crore for.\nBMW introduces Sky Lounge feel through a panoramic sunroof, which offers an immersive experience at night.\nThe unpolished wooden inserts along and brushed aluminum inserts on the doors, dash and at the centre are a classic BMW way fo reminding you the luxury.\nUse the controls to alter the comfort of the front seats, which are big and plush.\nThe iDrive gearbox is crystal-cut while the rotary dial with smooth tactile function allows you to sift through the car key controls.\nLoads of buttons around the central console is a little getting used to.\nThe cabin of the BMW will surely impress passengers with its massive screens, fancy finishes and truckload of creature comforts.\nBut wait a minute before you getting behind the driving wheel.\nUse it as a remote to lock or unlock, adjust the height of the SUV, access the engine parametres and even start the car remotely.\nSo, much before the smartwatches became a thing of normal, the fourth generation X5 owners had the tech at their disposal.\nOn the move, the biggest point of the difference between the fourth generation and the X5s of the past is the comfort factor.\nThe SUV trendsetter for BMW gets twin-axle air suspension for the first time.\nThe huge tyres, however, may seem to unsettle the comfort somewhat on rough roads and large uneven terrain.\nThat said, the X5 is mostly a soft-roader and BWM\u2019s Comfort mode strikes a balance between excellent ride and sporty drive.\nTake the X5 out on the open straights, the flat-six engine zooms to triple digits in around 6 seconds despite the SUV weighing over 2 tonne, almost matching the performance of a Porsche Cayanne.\nThe BMW also is easy to drive at its limits, with impressive stability from air-spring suspension and the looks, like most BMWs wouldn\u2019t disappoint.",

        "HYDERABAD: As international vaccine companies and academic institutions race the clock to deliver a safe Covid-19 vaccine, all eyes are on India that makes 60% of the world\u2019s vaccines.\nBe it India\u2019s first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin or Russia\u2019s Sputnik V, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Ad26.Cov2.S, FluGen\u2019s CoroFlu or even Sanofi\u2019s under development vaccine candidates, all have a Hyderabad connect.\nCovid outbreak: Follow live updatesWhether a successful Covid-19 vaccine is developed in Hyderabad or not, a vaccine developed anywhere in the world will be churned out of Hyderabad, says Dr Varaprasad Reddy, founder & chairman, Shantha Biotechnics Ltd. Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage\u201cAll Hyderabad vaccine companies are robust in manufacturing technology and have the capacity to manufacture millions of doses with good standards,\u201d says Reddy, who is awaiting Sanofi\u2019s own vaccine candidate in the first half of 2021, a chunk of which is expected to be manufactured in Hyderabad.\nHyderabad will be an integral part of the Covid-19 solution just by the dint of the sheer vaccine manufacturing capacity it houses, feels Mahima Datla, managing director, Biological E Limited, which has a tieup with Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, to develop its own vaccine candidate and a tech collaboration to manufacture Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine here.\n\u2018Hyderabad well poised to offer affordable Covid solution\u2019Datla, who is also president of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN), points out that most of the Covid-19 vaccine candidates are being developed by academic laboratories or non-vaccine companies, who don\u2019t have the requisite infrastructure and will have no choice but to partner with companies in India or China.\nIn fact, most of Hyderabad\u2019s vaccine manufacturers are in informal discussions for a manufacturing collaboration so that whenever a successful candidate is developed they can offer their manufacturing capabilities.\nFor instance, Indian Immunologicals Ltd, a human and animal vaccines maker that was set up by NDDB, has a new 20 million single dose (200 million multi-dose) fill finish capacity coming up at Genome Valley on Hyderabad outskirts that it is ready to deploy for third-party Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing.\nDatla points out that as no one knows whose vaccine candidate will be successful or by when, most manufacturers are open to offering their capacities to a successful candidate.\nEven Aurobindo Pharma has jumped onto the Covid-19 vaccine development bandwagon with the acquisition of a US-based R&D company earlier this year and hopes to have vaccine manufacturing capacities ready by March 2021.",
